# Homeworks
---------------------
All code belongs to me, Matthew Rogers.
It's a very long story, but was given permission by my professor to host my assignments on github as some may end up larger than preferred for a txt file. That and as I've been given freedom to get more creative and whatnot with the assignments as I have more experience.

Due to a credit issue, I'm having to take a intro to computer science course, so do not steal my work as my versions of the homeworks are not what you would be expected to turn in, on the off chance you find this repo and have the same assignments.
